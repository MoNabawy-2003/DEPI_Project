# Company Branch Network Configuration and Redundancy Setup

## Overview
This project focuses on configuring network settings for two company branches and establishing a secure link between them using dual internet service providers for redundancy. It employs VPN technology to ensure secure data transmission across both branches.

## Details
### Branch Configuration
- Configuration of network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) at each branch.
- Implementation of VLANs for segmenting and managing network traffic.
- Setup of DHCP, DNS, and other essential network services.

### Inter-Branch Link
- Establishing redundant connections between branches using two different ISPs to ensure high availability and failover capabilities.
- Configuration of routing protocols like OSPF/BGP to manage network traffic efficiently.

### VPN Setup
- Implementation of VPN tunnels for secure communication between branches.
- Configuration of IPsec/IKE to encrypt and authenticate the data exchange.

### Security Measures
- Setting up firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) to protect network perimeters.
- Regular security audits and monitoring to maintain network integrity.

## Technologies Used
- Cisco IOS for network device configuration.
- Various network protocols like OSPF, BGP, IPsec.
- Monitoring and management tools for continuous oversight.

## Goals
- Ensure reliable and secure connectivity between two company branches.
- Achieve high availability with ISP redundancy.
- Protect sensitive data through encryption and strict access controls.
